This is something that can generously be called a point and click adventure game. 
You essentially just look for the secret for fixing bugs, and it does involve a mechanic that doesn't show up that much, so I guess that's vaguely cool.
The graphics and story is kinda bad, but that's because I kinda rushed when I was making this. It technically has some dialogue as well.

This shouldn't take you more than around 5 minutes to play.
Coded using HTML, CSS, and some inline Javascript.
It is recommend that you play this on a computer.
